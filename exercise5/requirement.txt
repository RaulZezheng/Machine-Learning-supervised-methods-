The main programming task is the implementation of the AdaBoost applied on a set of MLP learners
which needs to contain the training and prediction functions corresponding to the AdaBoost. 
Finally, the performance of ensemble learner needs to be measured on two datasets by F1 score, 
and to provide those learners whose weight are the highest in the ensembles corresponding to the two datasets. 
In the answer the learners are identified by the number of hidden nodes.

Question: Run the training and test of the AdaBoost on the two datasets and provide the two F1 scores
computed on the datasets, and the learners whose weight in the ensemble is the highest one for both datasets.
The learner is identified by the number of hidden nodes.
The answer consists of 4 numbers:
• F1 score on make_circles dataset,
• F1 score on make_moons dataset,
• Number of hidden nodes of that learner whose alpha value is the highest on the make_circles dataset,
• Number of hidden nodes of that learner whose alpha value is the highest on the make_moons dataset.

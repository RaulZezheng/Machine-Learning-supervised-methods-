1. How many training samples are needed for the difference between the test error and 
the generalisation bound based on Rademacher complexity to drop below 0.4 (for the first time) when δ = 0.05?
To train with n samples, use the first n samples of the training set.

-About 77-80 samples
                                                                           
2. Continuing with the same data, how many training samples are needed for the difference between the test error and the generalisation bound based on VC dimension complexity to
drop below 0.4 (for the first time) when δ = 0:05? 
The VC-dimension of perceptron is d + 1, where d is the number of features in the data.

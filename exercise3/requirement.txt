This question, and also the next one, is about selecting the best performing hyperparameters by crossvalidation. 
Here we assume that the full data set is used as training which is split into training and validation
sets. In these scenarios we don’t consider an independent test set. This model could be extended to a complete nested cross-validation.

Let the stochastic gradient algorithm for Logistic Regression be applied to find the best classifier on the
Breast Cancer dataset of the Sklearn package. The labels of the Breast Cancer dataset are of {0, 1} which is converted into
{−1, +1}.

In each training, initialize the weight vector, w, to have zero components to reduce the dependence of the
results on the random initialization.

Normalize the rows of the input matrix to have the L∞ norm to be equal to 1. 
Without that normalization overflow error might occur in the exponential function!
The training examples are processed in the order appearing in the original data file, no randomization
is applied to avoid the random fluctuation of the accuracy values. The hyperparameters are given by the
following rules. The number of iteration is equal to 50. The step size is taken from a list [0.1, . . . , 1.0].

1. The task is to run the Logistic Regression algorithm via the 5-fold cross-validation. 
The training and validation examples are selected by applying the KFold function from the sklearn.model_selection module.
In each fold compute the ROC-AUC score, the area under the ROC curve as an accuracy measure on the corresponding validation set.
Run this procedure for all step size hyperparameters. There are 50 training and validation sets altogether. 
For each step size hyperparameter compute the average ROC-AUC score on the 5 folds.
Question: what is value of the maximum average score, and the corresponding value of the step size of the 10 different step sizes?

-0.94, 0.6

2. In this question the code constructed above is reused with the following modifications. 
The step size is fixed to 0.1, but the number of iterations is going through on a list [10, . . . , 100]. 
Every other part of the code: the algorithm of the logistic regression, the 5-fold cross
validation and the row wise normalization by L∞ norm remains the same. 
The accuracy is also measured in
the same way, thus the ROC-AUC score is used. The weight vector, w, is initialized to zeros in this question as well.
Question: what is value of the maximum average score, and corresponding value of the iteration of the 10 different number of iterations?

-0.94, 90
